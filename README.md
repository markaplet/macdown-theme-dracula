# Dracula MacDown Theme

Drcula is a dark theme for the open source markdown editor [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/). This theme is inspired by the [Dracula Terminal Theme](https://draculatheme.com/terminal/). In fact, I created the MacDown theme because I enjoy using the terminal theme so much and wanted to have the same theme for my markdown editor of choice.

## Installation

Copy the **Dracula.txt** and **Dracula+.txt** file into your Mou Themes directory.

`~/Library/Application Support/Mou/Themes`

Open Mou's Preferences and navigate to the Themes tab. Select Dracula in the Use Theme: dropdown. If Mou was open when you copied the theme files, you may need to hit the Reload button.
