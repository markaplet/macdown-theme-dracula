# Dracula MacDown Theme

Drcula is a dark theme for the open source markdown editor [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/). This theme is inspired by the [Dracula Terminal Theme](https://draculatheme.com/terminal/). In fact, I created the MacDown theme because I enjoy using the terminal theme so much and wanted to have the same theme for my markdown editor of choice.
